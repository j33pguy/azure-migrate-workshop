.SYNOPSIS
    Step 4: Perform test migration to validate before cutover.

.DESCRIPTION
    Runs a test migration for each VM into an isolated test VNet.
    This validates that the VMs will work correctly in Azure
    WITHOUT affecting the source VMs or production network.

    TEST MIGRATION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE in real-world migrations.
    It's your safety net before committing to cutover.

    After validation, the test resources are cleaned up.

    VMs being tested:
      - OnPrem-Web       (Windows Server + IIS)
      - OnPrem-SQL       (Windows Server + SQL Server Express)
      - OnPrem-Linux-Web (Ubuntu + Nginx)
      - OnPrem-Linux-App (Ubuntu + Node.js API)

    Prerequisites:
      - Steps 1-3 completed (Azure Migrate project exists, VMs discovered, replication enabled)
      - Replication is in a healthy "Protected" state for all VMs
      - Az PowerShell modules installed (Az.Migrate, Az.Network, Az.Compute)

.PARAMETER SourceResourceGroup
    Resource group containing the Hyper-V host and on-prem VMs.

.PARAMETER TargetResourceGroup
    Resource group where migrated VMs will land.

.PARAMETER MigrateProjectName
    Name of the Azure Migrate project.

.PARAMETER Location
    Azure region for test resources. Default: eastus.

.PARAMETER TestVNetName
    Name of the isolated test virtual network.

.PARAMETER TestVNetAddressSpace
    Address space for the test VNet (must not overlap with production).
